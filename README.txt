We will be designing the protoype using Swing through WINDOWS BUILDER, which is an eclipse plugin. It shouldn't be hard to use but you have to be very careful.
It is recommended that you use UMPLE for code-generation based on the model diagram. DO NOT CODE CLASSES FROM SCRATCH or at least minimize it.

To install UMPLE as a plugin for Eclipse, follow this:

So in total, you need to install two eclipse plugins: WindowsBuilder & UMPLE
